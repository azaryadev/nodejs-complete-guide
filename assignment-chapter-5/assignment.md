1.  Create a npm project and install express.js (Nodemon if you want)
2.  Create an express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware
    functions that log something to the console and return one response.
3.  Handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one
    hande/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response)
